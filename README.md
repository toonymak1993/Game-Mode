# GAME_MODE

This project is intended to bring a computer as close as possible to a console. 
I see the main advantages of consoles in the fact that you switch them on and wait until the picture appears on the TV. It also has a great interface. Steam has already given us something good with the Big Picture, but unfortunately the PC with Windows is somewhat limited in bringing everything together. Game_Mode will do that in the future.I have built in a time limit which, when it has expired, puts the display on the first or second monitor, then starts Big Picture, before minimising all windows. With this, you can start your PC, for example via WOL or HOMEASSISTANT, and wait until the PC adjusts itself.

A wide range of settings is possible, such as setting the seconds, which monitor it should switch to, etc. Colours, backgrounds and text colours can also be set.
